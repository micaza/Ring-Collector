# Ring-Collector python game

I made during my college years to learn Python. I use open source game engine called PyGame (http://www.pygame.org) to develop this game. I learned this by myself by following online tutorials, youtube videos, and the PyGame documentation. This was my first introduction to Python.

### How to run

Install PyGame with PIP

```
pip pygame
```

Run game with Python command

```
python Main.py
```
### macOS Mojave users

There's an issue with PyGame and the Homebrew version of Python3.7.x. If you want to run this Python file, I recommend to download the latest version of Python from [Python's official site]: https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/ and installing Pygame with by running `pip3 pygame` in the terminal. To run the main file with Python 3 in Mac use this command `python3 Main.py`.
